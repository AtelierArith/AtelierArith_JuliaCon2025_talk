## Description

This webpage serves as a repository for the presentation materials and links I will be discussing at [JuliaCon 2025](https://juliacon.org/2025/).

- [Slide](slide/slide.qmd)
  - We propose a technique for translating Julia documents written in Markdown. The proposed method is primarily intended to assist non-native English speakers.

## Appendix

- This page is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). The `qmd` files are maintained at [this repository](https://github.com/AtelierArith/AtelierArith_JuliaCon2025_talk). Readers are free to use these materials for educational and research purposes.
