title: "Letâ€™s read Julia documentation in your preferred language"
---

## Description

This webpage serves as a repository for the presentation materials and links I will be discussing at JuliaCon 2025.

- [Slides](slide/slide.qmd)
  - I will present a proposal for a technology that translates Julia documentation written in Markdown. This proposed method primarily aims to assist non-native English speakers.

## Appendix

- This page is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). The `qmd` files are maintained at [this repository](https://github.com/AtelierArith/AtelierArith_JuliaCon2025_talk). Readers are free to use these materials for educational and research purposes.
